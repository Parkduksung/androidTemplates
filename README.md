Android Architecture Starter Templates (beta)
==================

‚úÖ **What it is**: A collection of templates featuring a layered architecture ready to be used in greenfield projects
or quick experiments, following the [Guide to app architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture).

üôÖ **What it's not**: These templates are not designed to be educational code samples. For that, check out [Architecture Samples](https://github.com/android/architecture-samples), the [Now In Android sample](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid) or [Compose samples](https://github.com/android/compose-samples).

Templates are compatible with the latest **stable** version of Android Studio.

| Template  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [`base`](https://github.com/android/architecture-templates/tree/base)  | Reactive architecture, Compose, database, single module  |
| [`multimodule`](https://github.com/android/architecture-templates/tree/multimodule)  | Base template + multimodule  |

## Usage

1. Clone the repository, optionally choosing a branch. For example, to check out the `base` branch:

```
git clone https://github.com/android/architecture-templates.git --branch base
```

2. Run the customizer script:

```
./customizer.sh your.package.name DataItemType [YourAppName]
```

* `your.package.name` is your app ID (should be lowercase)
* `DataItemType` is used for the name of the screen, exposed state and data base entity
(should be PascalCase).
* Optionally, you can specify a name for your application (should be in PascalCase).

Note: the customizer script requires bash 4 and above. You might have to install a modern version
on macOS:

```
brew install bash
```
